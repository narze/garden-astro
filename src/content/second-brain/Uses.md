## Previously used

aka. Honorable mentions, and why I don't use them anymore

*   iTerm : Tmux is slow, prompt layout breaks when resizing the window.
*   Ansible
*   Fira Code font : I just want the change of pace, this font is really good.
*   Sublime Text : On the later years (around the time of Atom editor), I got less and less updates. Then when I found that VSCode is fast enough, I moved.
*   Oh-My-Zsh : Everyone uses this, so mainstream.
*   [z](https://github.com/rupa/z) : Not [Rust](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide)
*   Google Chrome
*   Evernote
*   Dropbox & Google Drive : It eats CPU / Ram usage
*   OnePlus 5 : I gave it to my brother
*   Amazfit Bip : I gave it to my father
*   [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) - Switched to [2Do](https://www.2doapp.com) since it was simpler.
