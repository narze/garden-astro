A collection of [homebrew](https://brew.sh) packages I use on my macOS machines. Most of them can be found on my [dotfiles](https://github.com/narze/dotfiles/blob/master/chezmoi/.chezmoiscripts/run_once_after_darwin_10-install-packages.sh.tmpl). To keep it brief, I won't add the well known ones here.

* [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com)

  A package manager for almost everything version manageable, I use this to manage [my Ruby, NodeJS, Rust, Direnv, etc. versions](https://github.com/narze/dotfiles/blob/master/chezmoi/.chezmoiscripts/run_once_after_darwin_31-install-asdf-plugins-macos.sh.tmpl).

* [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai)

  Tiling window manager for macOS, usually paired with skhd to manage shortcut keys that I mostly used up all my Option key (‚å•) shortcuts.
