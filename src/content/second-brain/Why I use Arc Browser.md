I plan to write details in a blog post later

* Vertical tabs view
* Auto tab nap
* Multiple profiles in same window
* Pinned tabs can set URL, can navigate away and "Reset to pinned URL" later
* "Little Arc" window, can choose which profile to open the window later
* Tabs / Profiles are synced through multiple Macs
* Split view
* Group pinned tabs with folders
* Rename Pinned tabs
* Built-in mini player
* Keyboard Shortcuts
  * Switch to last accessed tab (âŒ˜+')
  * Switch profiles
  * Pin / unpin tab
  * Show / hide sidebar
* Dev Mode
* Command bar instead of url bar
  * Be able to switch to any tabs with text search
* etc.

Improvements I want to see:

* CLI command to open url with specified profile (Arc does not have cli capability like Chrome yet)
* Sync extensions across machines
* Confusing when setting shortcuts with non-qwerty layouts
