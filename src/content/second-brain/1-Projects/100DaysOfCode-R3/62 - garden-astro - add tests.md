## Test links

To test that all links on the site are working, I'll use [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) as a tool to crawl and test the links.

\#til `document.links` contains all `<a>` links in a page [1] ![](1-Projects/100DaysOfCode-R3/attachments/62%20-%20garden-astro%20-%20add%20tests.png)

The test code will navigate to the homepage, then get all the internal links and `await page.goto()` one by one while excluding already visited pages.

```typescript
test("internal links are working", async ({ page }) => {
  const links = ["/"]
  const visited = new Set<string>()

  while (links.length > 0) {
    const link = links.pop()

    if (!link) break
    if (visited.has(link)) continue

    const response = await page.goto(link)
    expect(
      response?.status(),
      `Link error (code${response?.status()}): ${link} `
    ).toBe(200)

    visited.add(link)
    ;(await getInternalLinks(page)).forEach((link: string) => links.push(link))
  }
})

async function getInternalLinks(page: Page) {
  return await page.evaluate(() => {
    return Array.from(document.links)
      .map((item) => item.href)
      .filter((href) => href.startsWith("http://localhost:3000"))
  })
}
```

If the test fail I'll know the bad links and fix them accordingly.

## CI with Github Actions

Firstly, config the Playwright `webServer` configuration [2], then add the Github Action workflow provided from Playwright installation [3]. I also add Pnpm setup with caching.

```yaml
name: Playwright Tests

  push:
    branches: [main, master]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, master]
