I want to add comments section in [my digital garden](https://garden.narze.live) I was going to choose Facebook comments but it is more complicated and need a Facebook app. I chose [Giscus](https://giscus.app) instead (it uses Github Discussions)

The setup steps are simple, [add Giscus App in the repository](https://github.com/apps/giscus), enable Discussions in repo settings.

Then, choose the features of the comment box, then copy the code snippets or use [Giscus component library](https://github.com/giscus/giscus-component) to your web page and it's done!

Added comments and reactions are synced with Github Discussions on selected repository. Mine is on [narze/garden-astro](https://github.com/narze/garden-astro/discussions)
