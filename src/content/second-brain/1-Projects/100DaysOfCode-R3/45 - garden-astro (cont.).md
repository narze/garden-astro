# Garden Astro - Dev mode

Create a development script (Run with `npx tsx watch dev.ts`) to support editing notes locally on Obsidian and preview on the browser without pulling notes from Github (narze/garden), while it won't affect existing notes and git history
- Use `chokidar` to watch my Obsidian vault
    - [x] Check if saving file on Obsidian trigger the event
    - [x] When saved, copy the file to narze/garden/src/content/second-brain/local
    - Clear /local path on exit, and gitignore it
    - Handle file conflict (Use second-brain/local path so that it won't conflicted with existing files)
    - Editing file in obsidian will reflect to vscode instantly, and also on the local website üëç
- Problems found
    - Cannot edit local markdown files in vscode, the files will be replaced by Obsidian

Also created `import-brain-local.ts` to import notes locally from Obsidian, now this note will be published on https://garden-astro.vercel.app/100daysofcode-r3-45-garden-astro-cont
