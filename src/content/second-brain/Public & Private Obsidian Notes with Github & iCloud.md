All my Obsidian notes (including this one) is available on my [public second-brain Github repo](https://github.com/narze/second-brain) via backing up with [Obsidian Git plugin](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git). By the way I also have private notes that I want to be synced throughout my [devices](/uses). I added some rules to exclude files with [.gitignore](https://github.com/narze/second-brain/blob/main/.gitignore) all files and folders with `.priv` prefix will be for my eyes only. Then sync it with iCloud which works with my iPad flawlessly. (No solid solution for Android devices but I don't bother doing that, yet.)
